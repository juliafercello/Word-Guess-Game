Word Guess Game

### Project Overview

* This word guess game is a hoot!  It randomly selects an animal from a list and allows the user to play a traditional game of hangman using keystrokes.  When the winner guesses correctly, an image of the matching animal is displayed.  When they run out of guesses, the user sees the mystery animal.
